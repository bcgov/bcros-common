    <h3 class="font-bold">Bank Charges</h3>
    <p>Your financial institution may have standard charges that apply to EFT or wire transfer payments. Ensure your financial institution does not deduct charges from the payment amount due as this will result in an underpayment.</p>
      
    <h3 class="font-bold">Over or Under Payment</h3>
    <p>If an overpayment occurs, the over paid amount will be refunded after staff approval. Partial or underpayments will not be processed until the full statement amount is received.</p>
    <h3 class="font-bold">Bank Account Changes</h3>
    <p>If you have changed your bank account name or decide to use a different bank account, please inform <a href="mailto:BCROSRev@gov.bc.ca">BCROSRev@gov.bc.ca</a> of your new short name.</p>
